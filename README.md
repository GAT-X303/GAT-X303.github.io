# My website

This is the repository for my portfolio website where I will store projects that I have worked on. It will include my thoughts and personal reflection and in some case the source for these projects will be provided.

# Disclaimer

I did not create this website from scratch as it was merely a template I found and edited using my knowledge of HTML/CSS. In the future, this may change.
