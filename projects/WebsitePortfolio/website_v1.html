        <h1 class="display-4"> Website Portfolio </h1>
        <p class="text-left">
          The objective of this project was to use my knowledge of HTML/CSS and web design to create an online portfolio where I could store other projects while showcasing mine.
          At the same time, I could further develop my skills in those areas while having a feel for creating a 'full' website that would still benefit me in the long run. I could have used website like WordPress, but I thought this was much more fun and interesting.
          </br>
          </br>
          Generally, I would like to the design clean and simple so that the site remains easy to navigate. I'd also like to keep things somewhat orginal, but it would be a lie if
          I said I didn't pull some inspiration from other sites. Overall, I am content with the design. I will try and make things more pleasing to the eye in the future and maybe more reactive.

        <h2 class="display-4"> Skills Applied </h2>
        <h2 class="lead"> HTML&CSS </h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          This site was constructed using Googles material design library. HTML and CSS were used to tweak and adjust the site to suit my taste. HTML and CSS are not diffcult to learn and apply. Using the library was a bit more tricky as I had to look around and see what I wanted.
          It'a case where it's easy to find something when you know what you're looking for but not so much when you don't.
          </br>
          </br>
          In V2, the site was created from scratch using Bootstrap 4. This simplifies many aspect of using HTML&CSS especially with mobile devices
          or devices of different screen sizes. It was simply a matter of reading the documentation and applying what I needed.
        </p>
        <h2 class="lead"> Version Control via GitHub </h3>
        <p class="text-left">
          The website is hosted by Github and is stored there as well. This also allowed for the use of version control, in the case anything went wrong. It also made upgrading and revisiting old code easier.
          Git was also first used here. Mostly as a way to get a feel for the tool. When I used my Windows machine, I used the desktop program which made things very easy. When I used my Linux machine, I used the terminal. Not quite as easy but still easy.
        </p>
        <h2 class="lead"> Web Design </h3>
        <p class="text-left">
          Quite literally, my first ‘full’ website.
          Designed using what I that was user friendly and easy to navigate. Inspiration pulled from using other sites and my attempt at ‘Material Design Language’.
          </br>
          </br>
          For V2, more effort had applied here. Namely, in V1 a template was used that was already somewhat usable. This verison was from scratch and I had to decide the general look.
          It was kind of difficult mostly because there was so many opitons and a lot of was also a matter of taste. In the end I decided to try and create something simple since it seemed like a good choice to convey what I wanted.

        <h2 class="display-4"> Conclusion </h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          Admittedly, I did not make this site from scratch and as a result I would say it was not to hard setup this website. I did learn to read HTML/CSS of people much better than myself and this site was my first experience at GitHub.
          Notably, I still achieved my goal of setting up a portfolio site while learning and applying HTML/CSS.
          In the future, I do plan on creating on a site from scratch but for the time I will likely focus on sharpening my programming skills and focusing on my studies. The most difficult thing will be trying to develop sonmething that is nice and original.
