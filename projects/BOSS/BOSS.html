        <h2 class="display-4"> Overview </h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          This was part of the final year capstone at McMaster University. In the deparment of ECE, we are allowed to virtually to anything as long as it's approved.
          Typically the only requirements is that there is a hardware component and that it's realstic to complete. This must be completed in groups of at least 2.
          The project that our group decided to do was create an automated badminton shuttle launcher that could be either cheap or easily bult and open source. The idea was orginally mine, which was inspired by my passion to improve at the sport but could never afford proper training.
          We wanted to develop the product using items that are widely available so that it could be recreated by others.
          </br>
          </br>
          The goal was to eventually have a respository of different "builds" of the same or similar device. These would use different parts, fill different niches or even superceed the original.
          These different builds would be contributed by other people interested in the product. People can then choose from these builds and look through a list of parts and guides on how to build one themselves.

        <h3 class="lead"> Time Management </h3>
          <p class="text-left">
            By far the most diffcult thing. If we were given a month working 9 to 5, we would reach the same point it took us in the 8 months if not excced it. It's very diffcult to balance working the project while spending time on school.
            To add, we had to plan around each others schedules which invovled 3 members including myself that had part-time jobs. It was a good experience nonthless, and taught me how to actaully use an ajenda properly.
            The only real solution was late nights and splitting up tasks. For myself, I would be involved in every aspect since I was the main inspiration and the only one who played badminton.
          </p>

        <h3 class="lead"> Team Collaboration </h3>
          <p class="text-left">
            Like all projects, team collaboration exists. Typically school projects have a solution, and at time many paths to it. In this case, there was many paths and many solutions. There were times where disagreements occured, and generally speaking I think we handled them well.
            Since we were all very pressued for time, it was often the question of which solution would be more time efficient. Example being we wanted to 3D print everything, but access to a printer an print time would take too long. So we settled for a lazer cutter since it was free most of the time and much faster.

        <h2 class="display-4"> Conclusion </h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          Despite the exhaustion and 2 car accidents that was invovled in this project; I ended feeling very proud of what we had done. The judges at the presentation were very understanding and seemed interested in what we did. Considering we won something, I think we did pretty good.
          It was good experience, and honestly it's kind of what a lot of students come into engineering thinking it would be like.
          </br>
          </br>
          Generally, I can think of many things that can improved. Our weakest point was the mechanical related stuff.
          </br>
          </br>
          Now for my honest thoughts as a badminton player. Trying to use this device as a shuttle feeder is not practical. It's extremely unnatural to move and react to it. I can understand why similar devices are not as popular besides the price. However, I think I'm being narrow minded.
          Many players grow and learn to watch the racket and react to the sound of shuttle. This doesn't happen with a machhine like this. So there are no cues when to move besides the scream of the motors, which leads me to feeling that it's unnatural.
          I think I could eventually get use to this, but I think these kind of tools can still be super effective at training novices who haven't begun to learn this subtle cues of when to move.
