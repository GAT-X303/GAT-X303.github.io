        <p class="text-left">
          To design an Android application and apply my skills of basic Android development that would contain similar information to my portfolio site. The application was intended to run on the Nexus 6P(xxhdpi).
          Other verisons may be added. Really I just wanted to apply some of the stuff I've learning with Android development. Although this was impratical (who would download a portfolio as an app when a website like this exists), it was still prety neat to make.

        <h2 class="lead"> Android Application Development </h3>
        <p class="text-left">
          Although, not the first Android app that I made.
          This was my first attempt at making one without a guide and I was something I came up with.
          Some Android concepts used include:
        </br>
        -XML Layouts
        </br>
        -Android Intents
        </br>
        -OnClickListeners
        </br>
        -View manipulation(Setters,Getters,Adapters, and Recyclers)
        </br>
        </br>
        Overall, the concepts were not too hard especially since the application itself was simple.
        However, I still used a bulk of what I know relating do Android and learned how to use Recyclers along the way.
        </p>

        <h2 class="lead"> Java </h3>
        <p class="text-left">
          The programming itself was not difficult, but applied some Java concepts like constructors, overriding, custom objects and application of the Android library itself.
          Essentially, there was very little algorithmic problems but rather finding out how to use the Android library itself and reading through examples and documentation for what was needed.
        </p>

        <h2 class="lead"> UX Design </h3>
        <p class="text-left">
          By far the least enjoyable part, and likely the part I needed the most development on. This is largely due to the fact I have little experience in developing good UX.
          I believe, I am not that good at UX design but it is also the part I had the least practice and is something I will continue to develop as I develop more apps.

      <div class="box shadow p-3 mb-3 bg-white rounded">
        <h2 class="display-4"> Conclusion </h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          The development was not that hard, but rather making something that was visually pleasing was. It was not difficult to find images that matched the theme and even difficult to determine a theme.
          Choosing and crop images were also not that fun, and I can say confidently that having a person dedicated to the visuals would have been a great help and the overall quality.
          Again, I look to create an app that is more meaningful in the future. That being said, I prefer this to web development at the moment. Largely because there seems to be almost too many good ways to develop a good website. As opposed to in Android development, there doesn't seem to be as many "ways".
